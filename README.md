# what is Docker?
Docker is a containerization platform that packages applications as lightweight, portable containers that can run on any machine. 
Containers encapsulate all the dependencies and configurations needed to run an application, making it easier to deploy and manage. 


## how we can install it?
In this project, various methods of installing Docker have been explained, including the use of Shecan DNS to avoid any installation issues for our fellow countrymen.

I hope this project is useful for you.
